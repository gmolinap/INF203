Question 1a:

The source code of a webpage reveals the actual code written by 
the developer, often containing only the essential content. On the other 
hand, when inspecting the page, the browser's interpretation is displayed,
 including the addition of basic HTML tags. In the given example, the source 
code is limited to the text "My personal page from Telecom ParisTech," while
 inspecting the page shows the browser's incorporation of fundamental HTML tags.

Question 1b:

-------

Question 1c:

The browser does not present the title directly on the visible page as it is 
considered meta-information. Instead, the displayed content on the browser 
corresponds to the body of the HTML, while the information within the head, 
which includes the title, is meta-information about the page.

Question 1d:

-------

Question 1e:

Omitting a </div> tag may not visibly affect the rendering, although it alters
 the Document Object Model (DOM) structure. The browser often auto-closes </div>
 tags to recover from the error, maintaining the rendering consistency.

In contrast, neglecting a </strong> tag can have an immediate impact.
 The browser tends to prioritize closing </strong> quickly, leading to
 unintended consequences. When <div> elements are left inside an unclosed
 </strong> tag, they are encompassed by it, causing them to be displayed 
larger due to the inherent styling of the <strong> tag.


Question 2a:

----

Question 2b:

--Specify an id or a class for every div tag.
-- Much easier 
--All styles are in the same place 
--It is worse if you want to personalize each element differently.

Question 2c:

We should add a link tag on the head tag with the css file path.
The pros is that this method let the code more organized and not let
the files get too big.
